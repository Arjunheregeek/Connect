Augmented Reality Aided Medical Surgery - Currently, a lot of planning of medical operations is done before doctors enter an operation theatre but while performing the operation, they hardly have any feedback. In this project, we built an augmented reality tool to assist doctors during a leg operation to visualise the entire bone structure using predetermined 3D scanned models. These 3D models were registered with the real world location of the bone using Leap motion. We used Oculus DK2 and converted the VR headset into a AR device for our use case. 2. Multi Person Virtual Reality - All the current use cases of VR are aimed at individual use of Virtual Reality. But what we don\u2019t realise is that our spatial surroundings are very important and could be an important input to the game. Imagine that sitting on the leftmost row of a room. And imagine the virtual world is a roller coaster. What if based on your real world position, your position in the virtual world would be decided? We need position based virtual reality content in many other areas too. We created an event in IIT Bombay on 12th March, 2016 to test this idea. Beyond the basic premise of testing our experiment, so many people experiencing Virtual Reality for the first time in their life was a great promotion for VR in the institute. We used 200 Google cardboards for the demo. We developed an android application and installed it in people\u2019s phones. 3. Heart Rate aided Virtual Reality - The goal of this project was to provide heart rate as an input to the Virtual Reality games/movies to use to enhance user experience. We built a horror game, and the ghost in the horror scene was triggered when a person was calm, his heart rate was low to enhance effectiveness of the VR film. We used Google cardboard as our VR platform and used Mio fuse as our heart rate measurement device.

This technique involves magnifying minute motions in videos to be able to see them with naked eyes. The basic idea of the project is to magnify adjacent frame differences. The crux of the project is to \u201csmartly\u201d get those differences so as to not magnify noise along with the signal, how to magnify motions that lie in a certain frequency range. The workflow of the algorithm is as follows - - We consider each of the frame independently. - We convert each frame from RGB to YIQ/NTSC image domain. - We create an image pyramid of each of the color channel independently. - We perform some temporal filtering(like IIR, butterworth etc) on the input frames - We magnify the difference that we get from the temporal filtering using spatial filtering techniques - We do some chromatic aberration of each of the color channel to reduce the noise components - We add the magnified difference back to the original image and convert the image back to RGB. This gives us the frame of the output video with magnified motion. To add the above functionality in the code, I have also implemented YIQ color domain in the VTK codebase. Also I have implemented image pyramid class since it did not exist in VTK.

My journey has been anything but linear, shaped by hands-on experiences in product strategy, business consulting, and more recently, an intense immersion into India’s governance and socio-economic systems through UPSC CSE preparation. Professionally, I’ve worked with teams at Bank of Baroda, where I helped chart a digital roadmap projected to scale users by 250%, and at Syscon Wires, where I enabled a 35% revenue boost and INR 40MN+ in savings through market and supply chain strategies. I was also extended a consulting offer from FSG, driven by my interest in social impact and structured problem-solving. During college, I led one of Asia’s largest student-run entrepreneurship bodies, forging VC partnerships, scaling outreach across 20+ states, and representing India at World Expo 2020 in Dubai. These experiences shaped my collaborative mindset, storytelling skills, and a strong ownership ethic. Outside of work, I enjoy strength training, long walks, and mentoring young aspirants, whether in career planning, competitive exams, or life transitions.

My journey began at IIT Bombay, where I pursued Aerospace Engineering, immersing myself in the science of innovation and problem-solving. Those formative years nurtured my curiosity and laid the foundation for a career driven by a passion for exploring how data and algorithms can improve lives. Today, as the Co-founder and Group CTO of Innoplexus AG, I lead a team dedicated to accelerating the discovery of newer, more efficacious therapies. At Innoplexus, we are at the forefront of AI innovation, empowering customers and partners to address some of the most pressing challenges in life sciences and healthcare. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of building an IP portfolio of 145+ patents in areas like AI, ML, NLP, and information retrieval, with 45 patents listing me as an inventor. My professional journey also extends to my role as a board member at Amrit AG, where we’re creating a universal treatment discovery engine for diseases that have long eluded solutions. These roles have reinforced my passion for leveraging AI to solve complex problems and improve human longevity and well-being. Beyond work, I am passionate about community building. I launched the GPU Community, a thriving group of over 3,000 tech enthusiasts aiming to put Pune on the global AI map. Through initiatives like the TIP tech internship program, I enjoy mentoring aspiring entrepreneurs and emerging startups, helping shape the next generation of innovators. When I’m not immersed in technology or entrepreneurship, you’ll often find me trekking through nature, traveling to new places, or exploring new ideas through books. I deeply value time spent with family and strive to balance my professional aspirations with personal fulfillment.",19807.0,235.0,"[""technology"", ""aerospace"", ""engineering"", ""science"", ""innovation"", ""algorithms"", ""healthcare"", ""patents"", ""nlp"", ""inventor"", ""treatment"", ""mentoring"", ""entrepreneurship"", ""director"", ""responsible"", ""mobile"", ""networking"", ""django"", ""middleware"", ""components"", ""server"", ""wifi"", ""wireless"", ""oss"", ""management"", ""console"", ""billing"", ""portals"", ""provisioning"", ""security"", ""reporting"", ""design"", ""aerospace engineering"", ""problem solving"", ""life sciences"", ""information retrieval"", ""community building"", ""product innovation"", ""social networking"", ""customer care"", ""call center"", ""call centers""]","[{""company_name"": ""Innoplexus Consulting Services Pvt.

My journey began after completing my B.Tech and M.Tech degrees at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I initially embarked on a career as a software engineer at Version Data Services India, gaining expertise in ASP.Net, JavaScript, C/C++. After VDSI, I transitioned to Morgan Stanley Advantage Services, where I provided desk support from India, honing my skills in various programming interfaces including C/C++, Pearl, Python, Q/KDB, Excel-VBA and MS-SQL. My passion for creativity eventually led me to the world of Luxury and Fashion at Voylla, where I evolved from a Sourcing expert to the Head of Product Design &amp; Sourcing. My role also encompassed Planning and Analytics at Voylla, offering me hands-on experience in e-commerce, retail, and marketing. My journey took a transformative turn when I delved into human resources, learning, and development through coach training at Coach-to-transformation. I was deeply impacted by the positive change it brought to my relationships, both personally and professionally. This experience motivated me to join Meeraq as Director for Growth, Planning &amp; Analytics in January 2023. I'm a passionate and quick learner who is continually seeking opportunities for personal growth. Organizing and planning come naturally to me, and my affinity for numbers and creativity equips me to excel in analytics and data visualization.

I am also a recent Master of Design graduate from IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay, specializing in Interaction Design, with a keen interest in design and research. My journey began with a bachelor's in Civil Engineering from IET Lucknow. However, my passion for creativity and problem solving with empathy led me to transition into the world of Interaction Design. I gave CEED in 2021 and achieved All India Rank 4 on my first attempt. Throughout my academic journey at IDC, I've been enthusiastic about learning new design skills, tools and exploring different subjects and domains while working on various projects. As I venture into the realm of UX Research and Design, I am committed to creating seamless and intuitive experiences for users by blending both analytical knowledge with creative thinking. When I'm not immersed in the world of design, you can find me indulging in my love for digital illustrations, exploring self-improvement books, doing some online course, weight training in gym, or enjoying some good feel-good movie. These diverse interests keep me grounded and inspired, as I believe that well-rounded experiences enhance my ability to empathize with users and create meaningful design solutions. I am excited to forge connections within the design community, collaborate on impactful projects, and contribute my skills to shape the future of user experiences.
